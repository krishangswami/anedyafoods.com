         <p id="infor">
            Freeze-drying is a process in which any water is extracted from the substance. The finished product is sealed to prevent
            the reabsorption of moisture. The sealed and packaged product may be stored at room temperature without refrigeration,
            and be protected against spoilage for many years without any preservatives.
            Freeze-dried foods are closest to the natural composition with most of the nutrients being preserved.
